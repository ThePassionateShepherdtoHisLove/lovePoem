poem = """
Were Hank Hill to have seen you now,
“That boy’s alright” he would now vow.
We’d share a lawn for our dual gain,
My love burns like a propane flame,

We would take care of many pets:
Yeah, Centipedes are a true bet.
Our leggy friends will bright the day.
They’ll watch us when we hit the hay.

I’ll watch you and your integrals,
I’ll draw small hearts on decimals.
All day I’ll think about your name
Our love burns like a propane flame.

Our Rooster Booster boosts our bonds,
Our coffee beans could fill a pond.
Your frizzy hair does rizz my soul
At dinnertime we’ll share a bowl.

Frivolities and manatees;
We’ll eat some cheese; feel seaside breeze.
Topekan Methamphetamine
Will have us feel so truly lean.

We’ll join our lives and see the world,
And find the joys that fate has squirreled.
Throughout it all I’ll say the same:
Our love still burns like propane flame.
